 * from DB at compile time. In such case she or he should use methods readKey (...) and readPayload (...).
 * 
 * In case user is running in DataProxyProvider mode and does not know all the types at compile time,
 * she or he should use methods that returns DataProxy. It is assumed that these proxies should be then passed
 * to frameork, although this requirement is not enforced.
 *
 * For all payload read operations user has to provide a valid L1TriggerKey. It is expected that this key comes
 * from readKey method, although, if user is able to guarante that key is valid it can use any other source.
 *
 * Validity of all data is controled by validity of L1TriggerKey.
